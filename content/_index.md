As a seasoned Software Engineer with a passion for problem-solving, I thrive on
learning and applying new technologies to drive innovative solutions. With a
strong background in Back-End software development, I've had the opportunity to
wear multiple hats, from technical support to project management, allowing me
to bring a unique, well-rounded perspective and skills to every project.

Throughout my 19+ years of experience, I've developed expertise in a range of
programming languages, including C#, Go, Java, Node.js, Typescript, Python, and
SQL Databases. Recently, I've expanded my skill set to include Generative AI
(GenAI) and Large Language Models (LLMs), enabling me to explore new
possibilities in automated software development and operation.

Welcome to my website! Here, I invite you to join me in exploring the
ever-evolving world of software engineering and beyond. Expect engaging content
that simplifies complex topics, from mastering back-end technologies to
navigating the innovative frontiers of Generative AI and Large Language Models.
Beyond tech, Iâ€™ll also share personal interests like books, Linux, and Neovim,
creating a space for learning, curiosity, and community.
